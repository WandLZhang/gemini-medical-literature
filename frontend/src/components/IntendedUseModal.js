                This software tool is intended for use by <strong>licensed healthcare professionals</strong> to assist in the identification of scientific literature relevant to the molecular and clinical profile of individual patients. The tool uses natural language processing and structured querying to perform advanced PubMed searches based on clinician-provided inputs, including clinical history, prior treatments, and molecular diagnostics (e.g., WES, RNA-seq).
              </p>
              <p>
                The software is designed to streamline the literature search process by extracting potential actionable events from clinical text and retrieving related scientific articles. All search results are presented with direct references (PMIDs) to the original literature for full transparency and traceability.

The final decision regarding patient care remains solely with the treating physician. The software is intended to supplement, not replace, clinical judgment.
